## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a beginner Data Analyst with a strong interest in understanding how data can solve real business problems.
Coming from a finance background, I'm now learning tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and applying them through small, practical projects to build my foundation.
I enjoy exploring datasets, cleaning data, creating simple dashboards, and improving my skills one step at a time.
My goal is to grow steadily into a confident Data Analyst by staying consistent, learning from every project, and building a portfolio that reflects my progress and passion for analytics.

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy workouts. I love the “aha!” moment when data reveals something new and useful, and that curiosity keeps me motivated to learn more every day.
